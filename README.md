## Please complete the following problems in order

## 1. find-largest-in-list

Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.

Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.

Write a function that computes the running total of a list

## 2. fibonacci

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8. 3.

## 3. palindrome

Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.

## 4. fizzbuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

```
Hint 1: Read the question very carefully

Hint 2: The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand.
console.log(12 % 5);
// expected output: 2

console.log(-12 % 5);
// expected output: -2

console.log(4 % 2);
// expected output: 0
```

## 4. sort
